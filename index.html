I worked on it with my friend during the Hackers of the Galaxy hackathon. Its a choose your own adventure game that is not complete. We learned about team building and all had seperate tasks. I mostly worked on putting it all together using html and css.</p>

Although it has random commands there are many that are useful. For example people in the server can find out their schedules for the day just by asking. My server also hosted movie nights and a command was added to showcase the movie and details. Users can also play rock paper scissors with the bot. A random command that I coded is the /kill command which "kills" users by pinging them and adding a random minecraft death prompt.</p>

In order to learn how to use Android Developer I took an online course and tried my best to understand how it worked. This was a solo project that I did over the summer and has led me to wanting to create more projects like this and look more into app development.</p>

Although it was a struggle and took many google searches I was able to make the website responsive. Besides that the main point of this website is to have an easy way to look at all of our clips and funny moments we have had. Making projects like these is what really motivates me to pursue a career in computer science since theres so many different things you can do.</p>

It has other features like the ability to rate books and write notes. This project had contributed to the 5 I recieved on the AP exam.</p>
